INPUT: N, R and M

OUTPUT: 2D matrix 'C' denoting nCr % M in the form C[n][r]

LOGIC:
The idea is to store the Pascalâ€™s triangle in a matrix then the value of nCr will be the value of the
cell at nth row and rth column. To create the pascal triangle use these two formula:

    1. nC0 = 1
    2. nCr = n-1Cr-1 + n-1Cr

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(N*R)
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(N*R)
